# Unforgettable memories

I was always wondering how much would it cost to put images 100% on-chain.

Obviously blockchain is not meant to transact and store huge chunks (images) but i always wanted to have an always available storage where i can store my most precious photos - forever, literally. (Like the first photo with my daughter, etc.)

## How to use this project

Currently it is a 'sandbox' and shall only be used with testnets. The limitation of this is around <23kB images.
If you are about to try it out please do:
```
1. Search an image less than 23kB 
2. Convert to base64 with any online tool (e.g.: https://onlinejpgtools.com/convert-jpg-to-base64)
3. Replace the image string variable in Memories.sol with the encoded text.
4. Deploy with Remix and see on testnet.opensea.io
